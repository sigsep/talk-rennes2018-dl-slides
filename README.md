# Deep Learning for Music Unmixing

## Problem Statement

# Funny slide

## Classical Approaches: Unsupervised

  * NMF
  * KAM
  * short intro into source-filter models, NMF, repet, kam...
  * limitations

## Paradigna shift

 * when?
 * why? data, separation is only well defined for certain kind of data

## Supervised Source Separation

## Supervised Source Separation

  * Classification vs Regression
    Binary Masking, Deep Clustering
  * Discriminate vs Generative

  * Single I/O vs Multiple I/O
    Siamese networks, Deep-U net

  * Time Series vs. Frequency
  * its not clear if its a discriminate or generative problem
  * permutation problem


## Baseline System (Popular Decisions)

 * BiLSTM - Sequence to Sequence
 * PreProcessing
 * Structure
 * Training
 * Testing
 * Explain UHL2 (BiLSTM) == state of the art
 * deep clustering

## How hip is Source separation

 * [X] End-to-End Networks
 * [X] Fully Convolutional Networks
 * [X] Batch Normalization
 * [X] GANs
 * [ ] Capsule Networks
 * [ ] Attention Networks
 * [ ] Reinforcement Learning

## Research Directions

 * Unsupervised Learning to solve the permutation problem
 * Learning with limited amount of data
 * Improving Representations vs End-to-End (WaveNet)
 * datasets accessible for non-audio experts, require significant domain knowledge
 * Convergence of Signal Processing and DL
 * Model long term dependency
